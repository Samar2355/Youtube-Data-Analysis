# Youtube-Data-Analysis
I use Python, Excel, Power BI, and MySQL for this data analysis project.
In this, I've searched for famous YouTubers such as Pewdiepie, Markiplier, FutureCanoe, Vsauce, Daily Silksong news, and used 2 of their random videos.
They are categorized by genres, such as gaming/vlogging, gaming, cooking, science, and gaming news.
Firstly, I used Python and used YouTube's api, I got info of the YouTubers' video data such as number of likes, views, and comments.
Next, I exported the data to MySQL and organised the table based on its genres.
Finally, I used the data and created Graphs based on this data.
